# GenoCore : a simple and fast algorithm for core subset selection from large genotype datasets

The GenoCore python version was developed by Seonmun Jeong and Jae-Yoon Kim. 

This program is based on the GenoCore R version available at https://github.com/lovemun/Genocore.

Source code was written in Python language and supported on windows and linux platform.



# Usage


Usage : Rscript run_genocore.R input_file -cv coverage -d difference -o result_file_name


# Requirement

python3, numpy

GenoCore python version also works in python 2.0, but we recommend running it in python 3.0 for handling a large data set.
